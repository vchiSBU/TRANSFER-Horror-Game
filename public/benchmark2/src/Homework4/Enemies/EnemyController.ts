// HOMEWORK 4 - TODO
/**
 * For this homework, you'll have to implement an additional state to the AI from scratch,
 * and handle how it's used in the EnemyController and accessed from other states.
 * 
 * This new behavior should be for a spike ball enemy variant, and it should activate when
 * the player moves too close to the enemy.
 * 
 * The spike ball enemy should jump up and down constantly for as long as the player is nearby.
 * 
 * When the player moves far enough away again, the enemy should return to the idle state.
 * 
 * You have been provided with a spritesheet for the spikeball enemy, which comes with some
 * needed animation states. Feel free to change the sprite (or any of the art) if you want to.
