    TRANSFER
A Game For Browsers
Copyright 2021 Vincent Chi, Ahnaf Hasan, Noel Lee

TRANSFER is set in a New York style subway where you, the protagonist, need to figure out how to get home before the monstrosities catch up. In the eerie environment of a subway, enemies lie await. To win, you must persist through the challenges, which consist of puzzles, thrills, jump scares, you name it. Will you be able to make it through? Let's find out ;)

I. GENERAL INFORMATION
	The main character must solve a series of puzzles and survive the onslaught of enemies, unique to every stage.
Enemies:
- Rats are the first enemies you encounter. They are fast and numerous and you'll have to use the weapon you find and elevation to your advantage.
- Litter is your second enemy. You need to clean out all the litter before you can move the train.
- An ominous stalker is your third and final enemy.
	For an illustration of what the game will look like, visit the sketch at the bottom, it will look very much like a normal subway, but with darker elements the deeper you go such as flickering lights and poorly maintained platforms.
	You will need to find items and use them in the right places in some areas while in others you will just need to be thorough. You will path side to side, walking further up or down if you spot something unusual or just to thoroughly explore.

II. DETAILED GAME DESCRIPTION
	The main character is just your average Joe: office collar worker, single, and living a repetitive life. Everyday he takes the train to work, and everyday he takes the train back from work. This game occurs when one day all the passengers sporadically disappear and you're left in an abandoned train station where things just don't seem right.
	The first struggle you'll have to deal with is with a sliding door that doesn't open. You'll need to fix the door mechanism in order to get through and while doing so, enemies will be occasionally appearing, but you'll be able to fend them off.
	The tone is gloomy since this is a horror game, and the story is linear, going from train to train with no real purpose but to entertain and challenge the player.
	The objective is for the main character to get home. He'll need to complete puzzles and survive the onslaught of enemies he will face while doing so. The player will want to accomplish this goal because it will be the end of the "terror" and serves as completion satisfaction.
- The first stage involves fixing a door with gear the player can find
- Escaping the hordes of rats that get released from the very same mechanism.
- The second stage consists of collecting all the pieces of litter on the floor.
- A litter avalanche then commences and the player needs to get out in time.
- The third and final stage has the "final boss" so to speak. This enemy will have mechanics that the player will need to figure out and learn to avoid in order to reach the end of the game.
	There is a menu screen with a Start, Controls, and About buttons. It will be designed in a very aesthetically subway esq way. There will be a repeating train skidding by loop in this menu screen. It can't be bypassed (because we'll have put in a lot of work for it :D).
	The player must complete the puzzles to move forward and after completing puzzles, the player will be in a rush to get to the next train without getting bombarded by an enemy- with the exception for the last stage. In this case, when the player walks further in to trigger the spawning of rats and then stops, the player will then die in the first stage because there will be ambient enemies around to periodically damage the player.
	In the last stage, the player will need to figure out the patterns that our boss will have, which will change the further the player steps in, to supply more interesting gameplay.
	Rats and the final boss both have AI. Rats will simply walk towards the player but may occasionally skimper around as rats do. The boss, on the other hand, will follow certain predetermined patterns of both sight and movement. You can get rid of the rats by striking them with a pipe, which will be supplied in that stage, and you can play around the boss' mechanisms by observing his pattern.
	3rd person side scroller with an X Y plane.
Interactions will occur when the player is close to an interactable object.
When a puzzle is completed and the chase sequence is successfully beaten, the player will transition to the next stage in form of the train.

III. OTHER ASPECTS OF THE PRODUCT DESIGN
TRANSFER is a single player game where you play as the main character. He's just your average Joe: office collar worker, single, and living a repetitive life. Everyday he takes the train to work, and everyday he takes the train back from work.
Just like your average office collar worker, the main character needs to take transit everyday. And like many others, you'll need to transit through the nightmare that is a New York themed subway system. Locations in the game are visited in a certain order- the main character's job is to transfer from one train line to another, but on this supernatural and unfortunate day, he's found himself in the attention of many monsters.
Scene 1: This train is above ground and is the least conspicuous place of the three stages. The sky will still be visible, but cloudy, there will be small amounts of litter in the form of shreds of paper and plastic bottles, alluding to the next portion of the game. This is where the main character will first descend into what starts to be madness. To get to the next train, the main character has to solve a simple puzzle while dealing with rats.
Scene 1 Part 2: Unlocking it will cause chaos to ensue and the main character must make it to the next train in time while a horde of rats chase.
	Scene 2: The train then leads you to a darker part of subways - the underground system. Here, you're underground, but still in a relatively well lit area. Here, on the way to the next train, the main character encounters a sign that tells him to clean up. Feeling self conscious and a sense of morality, you clean up the mess that is left behind.
	Scene 2 Part 2: Upon completion, an avalanche of mess comes pummeling through and the main character needs to make it to the next train.
	Scene 3: The main character arrives at the final stop- and he needs to get home. This subway is very poorly maintained, lights are flickering, and an eerie presence looms about. Here, the main character must avoid entering the creature's line of sight and the many other mechanics that would cause the character to die. This is the boss fight of the game.
	After finally reaching home, the game would end and the credits rolled.
	This game will support WASD movement on a keyboard. E to interact with objects, and the cursor controls where the flashlight shines in darker scenes.
	The screen interface will have the amount of hit points remaining, and inventory icon, and dialogue will pop up whenever the main character interacts with something or says something.
	The game will have minimal menus. There will be the start screen with Start, Controls, and About, and in game inventory/bag will have slots for items on the left hand side and descriptions for those items on the right hand side. These may provide hints/clues as to what you can do with that object.
	Onscreen text messages will show in lower thirds in a dialogue box. Short and simple.
	Graphics will be pixelated and simple, striving to look realistic for the most part. Effort will mostly be put in to make the enemies look spooky.

Subway will look roughly like this:
